**Things I've added:**

Karma Points System:  Give each other karma points with the "+karma @username" command. The bot tracks and displays the karma points for each user.

Role Rewards: Achieve specific karma thresholds to unlock special roles in the server. The bot automatically assigns roles based on users' karma scores. ( Although I don't think this is how it's handled normally)

Star Roles: As users gain more karma points, they can earn exclusive star roles.

Karma Cooldown: To maintain a fair and balanced karma system, users can use the "+karma" command once every 5 minutes to avoid spamming.

Validity Checks: The bot thoroughly verifies the mentioned user's existence before processing the karma command. If the user tagged is not real or not a valid mention, the bot promptly notifies the user for accurate interactions.
